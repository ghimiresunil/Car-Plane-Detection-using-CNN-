# Car and Plane Detection using CNN

## Introduction

This project mainly focused on car plane detection based on Convolution Neural Network. We are using Python 3.7.3 and NumPy to build this program. But, you can use any version of Python to run this code.

The main aim of this tutorial is to improve our capacity to analyze the operating process and various CNN architecture based on detecting the car and the plane. Also to obtain knowledge on the basic parameter and hyperparameter that make up a complete program.
